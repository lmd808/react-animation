# React Hooks Practice 

## Problem:
Hooks simplify the building process, but how exactly do they work? I decided to build a application that stores my mini experiments with 
React Hooks. Further I take the time to explain what is going on in the code.  

## Technologies: 
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The scripting language used to manipulate the DOM. 
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)- Cloud platform which builds databases and websites deployed online. 
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) - Javascript run-time environment (used to execute server side code.)
* [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)- Javascript library for building user interfaces 
* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) - Mark up language used for structuring pages. 
* [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - popular framework for building responsive websites
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) -is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
